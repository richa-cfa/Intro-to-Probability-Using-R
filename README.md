# Intro-to-Probability-Using-R

My learning steps during the Coursera Course

To read data that is saved as a .RData file, we use the `load()` command.
As with most reading in file commands, inside the parentheses needs to go a piece of text, in quotes, that is the path to the file from the working directory (the working directory is the folder that R is currently paying attention to). The easiest way to get a R Markdown (Rmd) Document and console cooperating about this is to place the file with the data in it in the same folder as the R Markdown (Rmd) Document, open the R Markdown (Rmd) document in RStudio so we are looking at the contents of the document in the editing window, then in the RStudio Session menu, use the __Set Working Directory - To Source File Location__ command to make a common starting point. Then the code in the R Markdown (Rmd) document will use the same working space regardless of whether we knit the document or run code chunks in the Console.
